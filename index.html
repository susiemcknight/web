  <p>The Basic Rules
    A soccer game has two 45 minute halves with a halftime in the middle, which varies in length depending on the league or whether it's a professional game or not. To start the game, the ball is placed in the middle of the field and one team kicks it off â€“the other does the same in the second half. No one can touch the ball with their hand, except for the goalkeeper. To score, a player must shoot the ball into the net by getting it across the goal line and past the goalkeeper.
