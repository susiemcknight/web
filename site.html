  <h1>A Beginner's Guide to Soccer</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As someone who has played soccer their whole life, my knowledge of the various rules, from the minor details to basic foundations, is extensive. The goal of my site is to essentially some of the very preliminary rules of soccer, the ones that are necessary to know in order to play or watch a game, while also introducing some facts about the sport across the world. There is so much more to explore about soccer beyond this site, so I recommend doing so.
