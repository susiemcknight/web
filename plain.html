  <p><h3>The Basic Rules</h3>
    A soccer game has two 45 minute halves with a halftime in the middle, which varies in length depending on the league or whether it's a professional game or not. To start the game, the ball is placed in the middle of the field and one team kicks it off –the other does the same in the second half. No one can touch the ball with their hand, except for the goalkeeper. To score, a player must shoot the ball into the net by getting it across the goal line and past the goalkeeper.

<p><h3>Top Tournaments</h3>
    There are many elite and popular soccer leagues and tournaments that occur across the world. Some of these tournaments are the CONCACAF Gold Cup, UEFA European Championship, and the FIFA World Cup, which occurs every four years for both men and women. Some of the best professional leagues in the world are English Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, and the Major League Soccer, which takes places here in the US.

<p><h3>Current Best Players</h3>
    Many people have different opinions on this, but there are a few clear players that stand out among the rest. One is Lionel Messi, a 33 year old who has set records playing for Argentina and Barcelona. Another is Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Portugal and Juventus, along with rising star Kylian Mbappé, just at the start of his career playing for France and PSG.
